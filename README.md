# Your Reader Mobile App

### Motivation
I began this project as a way to test out the things I was learning in a [React Native online course](https://codewithmosh.com/p/the-ultimate-react-native-course) I was taking. In my internship with the Goodyear Tire and Rubber company, I had to create a robotic process automation prototype that could scrape certain website using Optical Character Recognition technology, so I decided I would figure out a why to incorporate OCR tech in a mobile app.
