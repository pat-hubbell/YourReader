# Your Reader Mobile App

### Motivation
I began this project as a way to test out the things I was learning in a [React Native online course](https://codewithmosh.com/p/the-ultimate-react-native-course) I was taking. In my internship with the Goodyear Tire and Rubber company, I had to create a robotic process automation prototype that could scrape certain website using Optical Character Recognition technology, so I decided I would figure out a way to incorporate OCR tech in a mobile app. I came up with this app, which allows the user to supply and image either with the device's camera, or from the device's photo library. This image is then processed using Google Firebase's ML Kit, which is a cloud-based API that can extract text with OCR technology from an image given in an API request. The result of this is then display to the user. The user can also listen to the results using Expo's Speech SDK, and a custom hook to control the audio playback.
